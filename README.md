# 🌌 GestureMorph Particles

GestureMorph Particles is an interactive AI-powered 3D particle experience that responds to your hand gestures in real time.

Using MediaPipe Hand Tracking + Three.js, this project allows you to control thousands of glowing particles and morph them into different shapes like a Heart, Saturn, Flower, Sphere, and Fireworks — all using just your fingers.
